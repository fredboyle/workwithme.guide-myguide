## Values

- **Efficiency** is important to me. We should be able to focus on our primary goals and tasks that our role demands.
- **Work to live.** Not live to work.
- **Knowledge sharing** is something I enjoy. Pair with me and we can both learn.
- **Why?** is my favorite question and one we should all ask daily. Don't settle for the status quo when it feels there might be something better.
- **Transparency** in communication, and in general. I have no secrets so don't be afraid to ask and please be as open with me as you're comfortable with feedback, discussions, whatever may be on your mind.
- **Entering in good faith**, whenever I interact with you it's a super safe bet that it's coming from a place of wanting to help, improve, or otherwise do something positive.

## Personality

I'm a **dork**, a **geek**, and generally **goofy**. Every once in a while I might even be **funny**. I'm very casual and transparent, however I am here to fulfill goals that my employer has hired me to do. I will be **pragmatic** about things. Will ask **why?** often so that I may better understand things.

Sometimes I'll take a more leading position and others a more following one. It all depends but in the end it comes down to what I feel the group or team wants or needs. We're in this together after all and egos get checked at the door.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Feedback is great, especially when it's constructive and will help me learn and grow. Please don't sit on feedback if I mess up. Just tell me, you won't hurt my feelings. I'd rather have an honest difficult conversation than no conversation at all.

If you'd like to give me kudos, please feel free in whatever form you choose. Usually I don't think what I do is something only I could do, anyone could have. It's more about the collective group and are we reaching our goals efficiently and with awesomeness.

## Work Patterns

I typically work 9:30 to 16:30 pacific timezone USA. I'm a single parent so mornings and early evenings are spent with the kiddo. I'll sometimes work after kiddo is in bed if I feel like it or there's a tangible work need.

Brainstorming is fantastic and necessary to accomplish certain goals. Some things just can't be decided by one person due to the group environment. I like focus time when the task is clearly defined and just needs to get done. Overall though I'm open and enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others.

Also please avoid too many meetings unless there's a clear goal that requires synchronous discussion. Assume asynchronous first unless that simply won't work for the situation.

## Communication Preferences

Slack is great for those brief messages, just chatting, or working something out asynchronously.

If it's longer and requires more details, as well as needing to be stored longer term, please e-mail me instead. Slack isn't always the easiest place to search for things so e-mail makes that easier.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

- I may become more direct and possibly louder in tone of voice
- I may shutdown and stop contributing to the discussion
- In general I'm not the greatest at hiding how I feel so you'll know if it occurs

### How to help

- Help me understand the why of things
- Show me that actions will be or are being taken
- It will vary depending on the situation, in general feel free to reach out directly and just ask me what I might find helpful in the moment

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

- Performative behavior instead of tangible action
- Jumping into solutioneering before the problem is clearly defined for all
- Continuing to do the same thing just because it's how it's always been done. Unwillingness to explore alternatives.

## Ask Me About

- Anything that comes to mind you might be curious to learn about me
